     * Adds the given key-value pair to the map. If an entry in the map

     * passed in.
     *
     * In the case of a collision, use external chaining as your resolution
     * strategy. Add new entries to the front of an existing chain, but don't
     * forget to check the entire chain for duplicate keys first.
     *
     * If you find a duplicate key, then replace the entry's value with the new
     * one passed in. When replacing the old value, replace it at that position
     * in the chain, not by creating a new entry and adding it to the front.
     *
     * Before actually adding any data to the HashMap, you should check to
     * see if the array would violate the max load factor if the data was
     * added. Resize if the load factor is greater than max LF (it is okay
     * if the load factor is equal to max LF). For example, let's say the
     * array is of length 5 and the current size is 3 (LF = 0.6). For this
     * example, assume that no elements are removed in between steps. If
     * another entry is attempted to be added, before doing anything else,
     * you should check whether (3 + 1) / 5 = 0.8 is larger than the max LF.
     * It is, so you would trigger a resize before you even attempt to add
     * the data or figure out if it's a duplicate. Be careful to consider the
     * differences between integer and double division when calculating load
     * factor.

     * 2 * old length + 1. You must use the resizeBackingTable method to do so.
